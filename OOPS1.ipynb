    "Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class and an object are fundamental concepts that help structure and organize code in a way that models real-world entities and their behaviors. Let's delve into both concepts with a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (properties) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. In other words, a class defines the structure and behavior of objects. Classes provide a way to encapsulate data and functionality together, promoting code reusability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class named Car:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.speed = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def accelerate(self):\n",
    "        self.speed += 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    def brake(self):\n",
    "        self.speed -= 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_speed(self):\n",
    "        return self.speed\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Car is the class, which serves as a blueprint for creating car objects.\n",
    "__init__ is a special method (constructor) that initializes the object's attributes when a new car object is created.\n",
    "accelerate and brake are methods that define the behavior of a car object.\n",
    "get_speed is a method that allows you to retrieve the current speed of the car.\n",
    "2. Object:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete, individual entity created based on the class blueprint. Objects have their own unique data and can perform actions as defined by the class's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Car class, you can create multiple car objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Creating two car objects\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022)\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Performing actions on car objects\n",
    "car1.accelerate()\n",
    "car2.accelerate()\n",
    "car2.accelerate()\n",
    "car1.brake()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieving and displaying the speeds of the car objects\n",
    "print(f\"Car 1 speed: {car1.get_speed()} mph\")\n",
    "print(f\"Car 2 speed: {car2.get_speed()} mph\")\n",
    "In this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 and car2 are objects created from the Car class.\n",
    "We call the accelerate and brake methods on these objects to modify their speeds.\n",
    "We use the get_speed method to retrieve and display the speeds of each car.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "yaml\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Car 1 speed: 10 mph\n",
    "Car 2 speed: 20 mph\n",
    "Each object (car) maintains its own state (speed) independently, demonstrating the encapsulation and separation of data and behavior that is a key concept in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse. Encapsulation promotes data hiding and information security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base class or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. Subclasses can extend or override the functionality of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes in a consistent way. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading. It simplifies code and makes it more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of objects. It hides the unnecessary details while exposing the necessary features. Abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, making code more manageable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() function, also known as a constructor, is used in object-oriented programming to initialize the attributes (properties) of an object when it is created from a class. It's a special method that gets called automatically when you create a new instance of a class. The primary purpose of __init__() is to set the initial state or values for the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the __init__() function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: It allows you to set the initial values of an object's attributes at the time of object creation. This ensures that objects are in a valid and predictable state from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Binding: It binds the object's attributes to specific values, making them available for use throughout the object's lifetime. These attributes can represent the object's characteristics or properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: You can define custom logic inside the __init__() method to perform any necessary setup or calculations based on the initial values provided as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the usage of __init__() with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"My name is {self.name}, and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating two Person objects\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the introduce method for each person\n",
    "person1.introduce()\n",
    "person2.introduce()\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Person class has an __init__() method that takes two parameters, name and age. Inside the __init__() method, it assigns these parameters to the object's attributes self.name and self.age.\n",
    "When we create person1 and person2 objects, we pass their names and ages as arguments to the __init__() method.\n",
    "We can then use the introduce() method to display information about each person based on their initialized attributes.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Alice, and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "My name is Bob, and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "The __init__() method ensures that each object of the Person class is created with its own set of attributes, initialized to the values specified during object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the self keyword is used to refer to the instance of the class within its own methods. It is a convention used in many OOP languages, such as Python, to distinguish between instance variables and local variables within a class's methods. The use of self serves several important purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (base class or superclass). Inheritance enables the subclass to inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from the superclass, promoting code reuse and establishing a \"is-a\" relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single inheritance occurs when a subclass inherits from only one superclass. This is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance allows a subclass to inherit from multiple superclasses. This can lead to complex class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    class A:\n",
    "    def method_A(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "    def method_B(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A, B):\n",
    "    def method_C(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "Multilevel Inheritance:\n",
    "Multilevel inheritance occurs when a class is derived from a superclass, and then another class is derived from the derived class. It forms a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n"
