    "Q1. In Python, you can comment code using the # symbol. Anything after the # symbol on a line is considered a comment and will be ignored by the interpreter. There are two types of comments in Python:\n",
    "Single-line comments: These are comments that are written on a single line using the # symbol. These comments are typically used to explain individual lines of code or to add context to what is happening in the code.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "x = 5  # This is another single-line comment\n",
    "Multi-line comments: These are comments that span multiple lines and are enclosed in triple quotes (''' or \"\"\"). Multi-line comments are typically used for documentation, to provide context for functions or classes, or to describe what a block of code does.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "It can span multiple lines.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Q2. In Python, variables are used to store data values. A variable is like a container that holds a value, such as a number, a string, or a boolean. To declare a variable in Python, you simply choose a name for the variable and use the equals sign (=) to assign a value to it.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "name = \"John\"\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "In this example, age, name, and is_student are all variable names, and 25, \"John\", and True are the values that are assigned to them.\n",
    "Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means you don't need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. Python will automatically determine the data type of the variable based on the value you assign to it.\n",
    "You can also change the value of a variable at any point in your program by simply assigning a new value to it.\n",
    "Q3. In Python, you can convert one data type to another by using built-in functions that are specific to each data type. Here are some common data type conversion functions in Python:\n",
    "int(): Converts a value to an integer data type. For example:\n",
    "num = \"10\"\n",
    "num_int = int(num)\n",
    "print(num_int)  # Output: 10\n",
    "float(): Converts a value to a floating-point data type. For example:\n",
    "num = \"10.5\"\n",
    "num_float = float(num)\n",
    "print(num_float)  # Output: 10.5\n",
    "str(): Converts a value to a string data type. For example:\n",
    "num = 10\n",
    "num_str = str(num)\n",
    "print(num_str)  # Output: \"10\"\n",
    "bool(): Converts a value to a boolean data type. For example:\n",
    "num = 10\n",
    "num_bool = bool(num)\n",
    "print(num_bool)  # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "empty_str = \"\"\n",
    "empty_bool = bool(empty_str)\n",
    "print(empty_bool)  # Output: False\n",
    "It's important to note that not all data type conversions are possible or make sense. For example, you cannot convert a string that contains letters to an integer data type. If you try to do this, you will get a ValueError exception.\n",
    "Q4. To write and execute a Python script from the command line, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "Open a text editor (such as Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code) and create a new file.\n",
    "Write your Python code in the file, and save it with a .py extension. For example, you can save your file as myscript.py.\n",
    "Open a command prompt or terminal window.\n",
    "Navigate to the directory where your Python script is saved using the cd command. For example, if your script is saved in the Documents folder, you can navigate to it using the command cd Documents.\n",
    "Once you are in the correct directory, you can run your Python script using the python command followed by the name of your script file. For example:\n",
    "python myscript.py\n",
    "Press Enter, and your Python script will execute.\n",
    "Q5. To slice the list my_list and obtain the sub-list [2, 3], you can use the following code:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sub_list = my_list[1:3]\n",
    "print(sub_list)  # Output: [2, 3]\n",
    "In this example, we use the slicing operator : on the my_list variable to obtain a sub-list that starts at index 1 (which corresponds to the second element of the list, since Python is zero-indexed) and ends at index 3 (which corresponds to the fourth element of the list). We then assign this sub-list to the sub_list variable and print it out using the print() function. The output should be [2, 3].\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. In mathematics, a complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit (which is defined as the square root of -1). In Python, a complex number is represented using the complex() function, which takes two arguments: the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "z = complex(3, 4)\n",
    "print(z)  # Output: (3+4j)\n",
    "In this example, we create a complex number z with a real part of 3 and an imaginary part of 4. We then print out the value of z, which is (3+4j).\n",
    "Q7. To declare a variable named age and assign the value 25 to it in Python, you can use the following code:\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "In this example, we simply use the equals sign (=) to assign the value 25 to the variable age.\n",
    "Q8. To declare a variable named price and assign the value 9.99 to it in Python, you can use the following code:\n",
    "price = 9.99\n",
    "In this example, the variable price belongs to the float data type, since 9.99 is a floating-point number.\n",
    "Q9. To create a variable named name and assign your full name to it as a string in Python, you can use the following code:\n",
    "name = \"John Smith\"\n",
    "In this example, we use double quotes (\") to enclose the string value of John Smith and assign it to the variable name. To print out the value of this variable in Python, you can use the print() function:\n",
    "print(name)  # Output: John Smith\n",
    "Q10. To extract the substring \"World\" from the string \"Hello, World!\" in Python, you can use string slicing. Here's an example code:\n",
    "string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "substring = string[7:12]\n",
    "print(substring)  # Output: World\n",
    "In this example, we use string slicing to obtain a sub-string that starts at index 7 (which corresponds to the first character of the \"World\" substring) and ends at index 12 (which corresponds to the last character of the \"World\" substring). We then assign this sub-string to the variable substring and print it out using the print() function.\n",
    "Q11. To create a variable named is_student and assign it a boolean value indicating whether you are currently a student or not in Python, you can use the following code:\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "In this example, we use the Boolean value True to indicate that the variable is_student is true (since we assume you are currently a student). If you are not currently a student, you can assign the value False to this variable instead."
